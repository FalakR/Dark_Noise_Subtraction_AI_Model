## Dark Noise Subtraction AI Model

- Around 500 dark frames should be acquired at the same temperature and settings as expected at the orbit
- Average the dark frames and subtract from signal images
- This method is good only if the temperature is known within an error of 0.1 C, otherwise software estimation of dark frames perform better like: [https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA596420.pdf] [https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA479337.pdf].

Currently, working on meta data matching technique.
